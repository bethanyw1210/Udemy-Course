  storyText: "I'm in a long, brightly lit hallway. There are eight guards armed with
    light rifles on both sides of the hallway. I am surrounded with no weapon. \n\nI
    could try to fight them, but there are eight of them and I have no weapon... I
    could also use my agility to may advantage and try to escape. \n\nWhat should
    I do?\n1) Try to fight all 8 of them\r\n2) Evade and run from them\r\n3) Surrender
    peacefully. You know there's no way you could get out of this."
